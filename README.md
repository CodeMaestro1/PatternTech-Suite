# PatternTech Suite

Welcome to the **PatternTech Suite** project, developed as part of the course **Statistical Modeling and Pattern Recognition**. This repository showcases various advanced pattern recognition algorithms and methodologies, organized into two main sections:

## Project Overview

### Phase 1: Classical Algorithms
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A technique for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: A method used for classification and dimensionality reduction.
- **Bayes Classification**: An approach based on Bayes' theorem for probabilistic classification.

### Phase 2: Advanced Techniques
- **Perceptron**: A foundational neural network model used for binary classification.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Advanced neural networks designed for image and spatial data processing.
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**: A method for estimating model parameters.
- **K-Means Clustering**: An algorithm for partitioning data into clusters.

## Report

The detailed project report is currently available in Greek. An English version will be provided soon.
